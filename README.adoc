= Book Store app

This is a demo project and is primarily intended to training and demonstrate my coding skills and use the tools I know. Project periodically grows and becomes more difficult as I learn something new.

This project simulates book store. Key entities are Client, Book and Order. More detailed information can be found at /docs. There you can also find L3 and L4 level diagramms https://c4model.com/[according to C4 model].

At the moment, the dao layer is implemented in three different variations, which can be switched by changing the value of the property "database.framework" (mybatis/hibernate/mangodb) at the application.properties
